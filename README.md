//BACKEND

//FRONTEND
To run the Frontend tests, you will need to have Eclipse installed, add some libraries and have the ChromeDriver.
Link Eclipse; https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Libraries; I will leave the necessary libraries attached in the Libraries.
To add them you must be located in Eclipse with the project in the workspace. Then with right click on the main path, select the option "Build path / Configure build path".
There, add the libraries in "Classpath".

You should also add the TestNG library; Link to copy; https://dl.bintray.com/testng-team/testng-eclipse-release.
In Eclipse, go to "Help / Install New Software", click "Add", name "TestNG" and add link in "Location". Give ok, check all the TestNG boxes and click "Next" until the installation is finished.

ChromeDriver; You should run and add the chromedriver file in path "C: \\ Chrome Driver 86 \\ chromedriver.exe".

If you followed the execution procedure correctly, you should be able to run the application.
